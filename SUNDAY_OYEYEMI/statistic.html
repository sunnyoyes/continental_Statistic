        <p>Most of the world’s people are friendly and decent except for the French. Some stereotypes really hold up, but on
            average, most of the people I’ve met around the world are extremely polite, friendly, and helpful. They are generally
            interested why I chose to visit their home. They are eager to assist if it’s obvious I’m lost or in trouble.
            They’ll go out of their way to try to make sure I have a good stay in their country. And, contrary to what most
            Americans tend to think (see #3 below), they often don’t know much about the United States (or necessarily care).
            Don’t be convinced before leaving that “everyone there is. Show a modicum of respect to people and their culture
            and you’ll be blown away by what you get back. Try picking up a little of the local language. Just learning how
            to say ‘thank you’ can make a huge impact. Sorry, I couldn’t resist. To be fair, France is like everywhere else:
            most people are decent. It’s just that France has a particularly large proportion of bad apples the give the
            place a well-deserved reputation. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people in France but also a disproportionate number
            of assholes (not travelers generally, but residents of France). This isn’t based on a single trip nor is it restricted
            to Paris. Almost every non-French local in Europe agreed with me on this one.</p>
